# IoT-based-Door-Security-system
This project is an IoT-based implementation that leverages an ESP8266 microcontroller to monitor object detection using an infrared (IR) sensor and send the data to ThingSpeak, a cloud-based platform for data logging and visualization. The system also includes a buzzer to provide immediate alerts for object detection.
